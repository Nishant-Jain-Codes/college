# Q1 What is Operating System

-   Operating system (OS) is a software program that acts as a bridge between hardware and software applications.
-   It manages resources, coordinates tasks, and provides a user interface for interacting with the computer system.
-   Functions include process management, memory management, file system management, device management, user interface, and security.
-   Types of operating systems include standalone, network, real-time, and mobile operating systems.

# Q2 What is Real Time Operating System

-   Real-time operating systems (RTOS) handle tasks with strict timing requirements.
-   Real-time tasks can be hard real-time (critical deadlines) or soft real-time (tolerates slight delays).
-   RTOS provides determinism, ensuring tasks meet their deadlines predictably.
-   Task scheduling algorithms prioritize and manage task execution.
-   Efficient interrupt handling mechanisms respond to external events promptly.
-   Resource management optimizes CPU, memory, and peripheral allocation for real-time tasks.
-   Timing services facilitate precise timekeeping and task synchronization.

# Q3 Multiprogramming vs Multiprocessing OS

-   Multiprogramming OS:

    -   Maximizes CPU utilization by switching between programs.
    -   Programs appear to run concurrently, but actually run sequentially.
    -   Shares CPU time among programs through time slicing.
    -   Communication occurs indirectly through shared resources or OS services.
    -   Examples include early versions of UNIX and Windows 3.x.

    -   Share a common memory.
    -   Any processor/core can execute any task.
    -   Load is dynamically balanced.
    -   Communication occurs via shared memory or interconnects.
    -   High fault tolerance due to redundancy.
    -   Highly scalable with increased processors/cores.

    -   Processors/cores may differ in architecture, capabilities, or roles.
    -   May have dedicated or separate memory regions.
    -   Specific tasks are assigned to specific processors/cores.
    -   Load balancing may be limited or not required.
    -   Communication may require explicit coordination mechanisms.
    -   Relies on individual processors/cores for fault tolerance.
    -   Limited scalability due to asymmetric design.
    -   Power efficiency may vary depending on the workload.
    -   Examples include heterogeneous embedded systems and automotive systems.

-   System utilities and tools: Providing administrative and monitoring utilities.

# Q6 Shell Vs Kernel

-   Shell:

    -   Command-line interface for executing user commands
    -   Interprets and executes user commands, runs scripts, and launches applications
    -   Provides features like input/output redirection, piping, and scripting capabilities
    -   Examples include Bash, PowerShell, and Zsh
-   Kernel:

    -   Core component of the operating system
    -   Manages system resources and provides essential services
    -   Handles process management, memory management, file system operations, device management, and scheduling
    -   Classified based on architecture and functionality (e.g., monolithic, microkernel, hybrid)
    -   Examples include Linux kernel, Windows NT kernel, and macOS kernel (XNU)
-   Interaction:

    -   Shell: Provides a user interface for interacting with the operating system
    -   Kernel: Interacts directly with hardware, managing resources and low-level operations
-   Customization:

    -   Shell: Users can customize the environment, configure settings, and write scripts
    -   Kernel: Highly customized and optimized for specific operating systems
-   User Privileges:

    -   Shell: Operates with user's privileges and permissions
    -   Kernel: Operates in a privileged mode, enforcing security and managing user permissions

# Q7 Monolithic vs Microkernel OS

-   Monolithic OS:

    -   Single kernel providing all operating system services.
    -   Handles process management, memory management, file system, device drivers, and networking protocols.
    -   Susceptible to system crashes if a kernel component fails.
    -   Generally offers better performance with no inter-process communication overhead.
    -   Less flexible and extensible, requiring changes to the kernel for adding or modifying functionality.
    -   Larger trusted computing base, making it more vulnerable to security threats.
    -   Examples: Linux, UNIX, early versions of Windows.
-   Microkernel OS:

    -   Small kernel providing only essential services.
    -   Basic services include process management, inter-process communication, and memory management.
    -   Other services run as user-level processes outside the kernel.
    -   Offers increased system stability as failures in user-level processes do not affect the kernel.
    -   May have performance overhead due to inter-process communication.
    -   More flexible and extensible, allowing the addition or modification of services without changing the kernel.
    -   Better security isolation as most services run outside the kernel.
    -   Examples: QNX, MINIX, L4, seL4.

# Q8 Process Switch Vs Mode Switch

Process Switch:

-   Process switch refers to the mechanism of switching the CPU from one process to another in a multitasking operating system.
-   It is triggered by the operating system's scheduling algorithm.
-   The purpose is to allow multiple processes to share the CPU, enabling multitasking and concurrent execution.
-   During a process switch, the CPU's current execution state is saved for the current process, and the saved state of the next process is restored.
-   Process switches involve saving and restoring the execution state, updating process control blocks, and potentially swapping memory contexts.
-   Examples of process switches can be found in UNIX, Windows, and Linux operating systems.

Mode Switch:

-   Mode switch, also known as context switch, refers to the transition of the CPU between different privilege levels or modes.
-   It is triggered by events such as interrupts, system calls, or exceptions that require a change in privilege level or a switch between user and kernel mode.
-   The purpose of a mode switch is to enable the CPU to perform different tasks with varying privilege levels.
-   During a mode switch, the CPU saves the current execution state and loads the execution state of the target mode.
-   Mode switches incur overhead due to saving and restoring execution state, performing mode-specific operations, and potentially managing memory.
-   Mode switches occur in all operating systems during transitions between user mode and kernel mode, such as in handling system calls, interrupts, and exceptions.

# Q9 Batch OS

-   A batch operating system processes a large volume of similar jobs or tasks in a sequential manner without user intervention for each job.
-   Jobs are submitted to the operating system and stored in a job queue until processed.
-   The operating system's scheduler determines the order in which jobs are executed.
-   Jobs are executed in the background, with system resources allocated as available.
-   Input/output (I/O) operations are performed asynchronously, allowing for continued processing of other jobs.
-   Upon completion, the batch system generates output or results.
-   Examples of batch operating systems include IBM OS/360, UNIX/Linux with `cron`, Windows Task Scheduler, and HPC clusters.
-   Batch systems are used for efficient processing of repetitive tasks without constant user interaction, improving productivity and system utilization.
